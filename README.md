## Hey there 👋

I am Akshit Garg, an enthusiast currently hacking on some of my own projects.

I love to work with cryptography, interpreters, compilers and distributed
systems and retro computers. I am proficient with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org),
[ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org), [Golang](https://golang.org), JavaScript,
TypeScript and Dart amongst others. Currently hacking on wasm, retro systems and WebAudio.

As you might have guessed, I love lesser known programming languages and
systems.
